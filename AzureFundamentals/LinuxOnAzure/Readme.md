### Introduction

Microsoft Azure is a growing collection of integrated public cloud services, including virtual machines, networking, storage, databases, analytics, mobile, and web services. It enables you to build, manage, and deploy applications globally and at scale, by using your preferred tools and frameworks. But it's not just about Microsoft software: if your organization uses Linux-based development environments and runs production software on Linux, there's a place for you on Azure.

With Azure, you can power your applications with your preferred Linux distribution on Azure virtual machines and Azure virtual machine scale sets, for elasticity based on demand. The virtual network infrastructure of Azure, as well as its tools and applications, can add value to your Linux-based apps. You can also take full advantage of the unique managed service platforms (platform as a service) on Azure, to reduce the management burden of your applications without sacrificing the Linux foundation that you rely on. Microsoft is a neutral technology provider, working with all major Linux distribution partners and community distributions to offer you the most comprehensive choice of Linux and Linux-based apps.

In this module, you'll see what it means to run Linux on Azure, and how to think about moving your Linux applications and workloads to the cloud. You'll learn about the value of the Azure virtual Linux infrastructure and Linux-based service platforms, and how and when to think about taking advantage of both.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Differentiate between Linux on Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) computing, and the value of each.
* Describe Azure tools and services that bring additional value to Linux workloads.
* Explain the components of Linux virtual infrastructure in Azure, and the role of Microsoft in supporting different Linux distributions.
* Describe the value of Linux-based service platforms on Azure.
Envision building new Linux-based workloads and migrating existing workloads to Azure.
* Evaluate whether Linux on Azure is the right choice for your solutions.

# What is Linux on Azure?

"Linux on Azure" broadly encompasses two different kinds of Azure support for Linux applications and workloads: infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS). Let's explore exactly what those terms mean, and learn more about additional Azure services and features you can take advantage of regardless of how you use Linux on Azure.
